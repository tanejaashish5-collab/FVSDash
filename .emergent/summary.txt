<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to replace several mocked integrations in the ForgeVoice Studio application with real, production-grade services. The key integrations to be implemented are:
1.  **ElevenLabs for Audio Generation**: Replace the mocked audio creation in the FVS (ForgeVoice System) production pipeline with real text-to-speech generation using the ElevenLabs API.
2.  **Google Veo for Video Generation**: Wire in the Veo API to handle video creation tasks initiated from the Video Lab UI, replacing the current mocked implementation.
3.  **Harden Existing Integrations**: Solidify the existing OpenAI GPT-Image-1 thumbnail generation and ensure all LLM calls correctly use the .

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- All new API keys (, , etc.) must be read from environment variables.
- Integrations must fail gracefully. If an API key is missing or a call fails, the system should log a warning, fall back to a mocked URL, and complete the user-facing flow without crashing.
- The external contracts of existing API endpoints (, ) must not change.
- Use provider-hosted URLs for generated media for now, but add  comments for a future move to a dedicated storage service.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack product with a modular FastAPI backend and a React frontend. Key completed features include:
-   **JWT Authentication**: Supports  and  roles.
-   **FVS (ForgeVoice System)**: An AI-powered content orchestration pipeline that can propose ideas and produce episodes. It currently uses a real LLM for scripts and real OpenAI GPT-Image-1 for thumbnails, but audio generation is mocked.
-   **Backend Refactoring**: The backend has been successfully migrated from a monolithic  to a clean, modular structure with , , and .
-   **Admin Panel & Impersonation**: A fully functional admin dashboard allows administrators to view and log in as any client to see the app from their perspective.
-   **Video & Strategy Labs**: UI and mocked backend endpoints for experimenting with AI content generation.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was beginning the task of integrating real media generation services. It successfully used the  tool to get detailed implementation plans for Google Veo and ElevenLabs and was in the process of reviewing the existing service files (, ) to understand where to inject the new logic.
    - Status: NOT STARTED
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? both
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no outstanding issues.

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1:  Integrate Real Services for Media Generation (P0)
     - Where to resume: The agent has the integration playbooks and has examined the target service files. The next step is to begin coding the integrations.
        1.  **ElevenLabs**: In , implement the  function to call the ElevenLabs API using  and the specified . Update  to use this function.
        2.  **Google Veo**: In , implement the video creation and status-checking logic for the  provider using . Update the  to trigger this logic.
        3.  **Configuration**: Add placeholders and descriptive comments for the new keys (, , ) to .
        4.  **Error Handling**: For both integrations, ensure that missing keys or API failures result in a logged warning and a fallback to a mock URL, allowing the user flow to complete successfully.
     - What will be achieved with this?: The application's core media generation features will transition from mocked placeholders to fully functional, real-world services.
     - Status:  IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?: both
     - Blocked on something: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
    - P1: Fully test the new ElevenLabs and Veo integrations end-to-end.
- **Future Tasks:**
    - P1: Implement a dedicated storage service (e.g., S3/GCS) and refactor the media services to upload generated files there instead of using provider-hosted URLs.
    - P2: Integrate Stripe to replace the mocked billing system.
    - P2: Implement deep-linking between different pages of the dashboard.
    - P2: Implement a real integration for the Runway video provider.
    - P2: Add a feature for admins to onboard new clients directly from the admin panel.

**Completed work in this session**
- **FVS System UI Activation**: The existing but dormant  page was fully wired into the application by adding its route and sidebar navigation link.
- **Backend Refactoring**: The monolithic  was successfully decomposed into a scalable, modular FastAPI structure with clear separation of concerns (, , ).
- **Admin Panel & Impersonation**: A comprehensive admin dashboard was built from scratch, allowing admins to view all clients and impersonate them. This involved significant frontend work (, impersonation banner) and backend updates to nearly all data-fetching endpoints to respect the impersonation context.
- **Real Thumbnail Generation**: The FVS pipeline was upgraded to generate real thumbnails using OpenAI's GPT-Image-1 model via the , complete with graceful fallbacks.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, React Router,  API, Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Modular FastAPI, Pydantic for data modeling.
- **Database**: MongoDB (via ).
- **Authentication**: JWT with / roles and a robust impersonation system for admins.
- **AI/Media Integrations**: An abstracted service layer for  (LLMs), OpenAI (Images), ElevenLabs (Voice), and Google Veo (Video).

**key DB schema**
  - No changes to the database schema in this session.

**changes in tech stack**
  - The  Python SDK was installed in preparation for the integration.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains abstracted logic for audio and image generation. **This is where the ElevenLabs implementation will go.**
-   : Contains logic for multi-provider video generation. **This is where the Google Veo implementation will go.**
-   : Orchestrates the content production pipeline and will need to be updated to call the new real audio service.
-   : The environment file where new API keys and configuration will be documented.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The application currently uses provider-hosted URLs for generated media.  comments should be added during the upcoming implementation to flag areas where a future, centralized  should be integrated to upload assets to a first-party bucket (e.g., S3 or GCS).

**key api endpoints**
-   : The FVS orchestration endpoint whose internal logic will be updated to call the real ElevenLabs service.
-   : The Video Lab endpoint that will be updated to trigger real video generation tasks with Google Veo.
-    & : The core endpoints powering the recently completed Admin Panel.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   Your immediate task is to implement the real ElevenLabs and Google Veo integrations based on the playbooks you just fetched.
-   Focus your work in  (for ElevenLabs) and  (for Veo).
-   Remember to implement graceful fallbacks for all new integrations. If an API key is missing or a call fails, the system must log a warning and use a mocked URL to ensure the user-facing process completes without errors.
-   All new keys (, , etc.) must be read from environment variables. Add commented-out examples to the  file.
-   The user has specified to use provider-hosted URLs for now, so do not implement file uploads to S3/GCS. Add  comments where this future work would plug in.
