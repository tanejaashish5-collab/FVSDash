<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's objective is to build a comprehensive content lifecycle management system, ForgeVoice Studio. The previous sprint, **Sprint 10: UI Wiring + Foundation Fixes**, focused on wiring up the remaining UI components to the backend services, and fixing a list of critical bugs and UI/UX issues.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (Sprint 10 - Completed):**

*   **Part A (P0): FVS System - Wire AI Recommendations:** Replaced the static ideas table with live AI recommendations from , displayed as interactive cards, and added a button to trigger new scans.
*   **Part B (P0): Analytics Page - Add Trend Intelligence Tab:** Added a Trend Intelligence tab to the analytics page to display competitor data and trending keywords.

*   **Part D (P1): ROI Center - Fix Calculation:** Reworked the ROI calculation to use a YouTube-native model based on an editable CPM and sponsorship value, pulling metrics from the analytics backend.
*   **Part E (P1): Critical Bug Fixes:**
    1.  Implemented automatic YouTube token refresh logic.
    2.  Replaced generic blog content with 5 Chanakya Sutra-themed articles.
    3.  Fixed the Failed to load help data error toast.
    4.  Pre-populated the Tone field in the Strategy Lab from the user's channel profile.
    5.  Showed image previews for thumbnail assets on the Assets page.
*   **Part F (P1): Navigation Cleanup:** Renamed Deliverables to Production Files and added a video count badge to the Submissions sidebar link.

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack system (FastAPI, React, MongoDB) with a functional Google OAuth 2.0 flow. All UI elements outlined in Sprint 10 are now fully wired to the backend. The FVS system shows live AI ideas, the Analytics page has a Trend Intelligence tab, the Overview dashboard and ROI Center display live channel metrics with a correct CPM-based model, the blog has been updated with new content, and several critical bugs (including YouTube token refresh) have been fixed. The application is stable and has been tested by the agent.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Sprint 10 - All Parts (DONE):**
  - **FVS System Page (Part A):** Wired to  to show live, interactive AI idea cards.
  - **Analytics Page (Part B):** Added a Trend Intelligence tab with  and  components.
  - **Overview Dashboard (Part C):** Now displays live channel health statistics.
  - **ROI Center Page (Part D):** Rebuilt the ROI calculation to use an editable CPM (default .50) and sponsorship value.
  - **YouTube Token Auto-Refresh (Part E):** Implemented a frontend Axios interceptor in  to catch 401 errors and trigger the backend refresh token flow.
  - **Blog Content (Part E):** Replaced placeholder content with 5 authentic Chanakya Sutra-themed articles via a database migration script ().
  - **Help Page Bug (Part E):** Fixed the Failed to load help data toast by adding graceful handling for empty data arrays on the frontend.
  - **Strategy Lab Tone (Part E):** Ensured the 'tone' field is correctly pre-populated from the user's channel profile.
  - **Asset Thumbnails (Part E):** The testing agent applied a fix to make image URL detection case-insensitive, ensuring thumbnail previews render correctly.
  - **Navigation Cleanup (Part F):** Renamed Deliverables to Production Files and added a video count badge to the Submissions link in the sidebar.
- **End-to-End Testing (DONE):**
  - Performed comprehensive manual verification via screenshots for every new feature.
  - Invoked , which confirmed all features passed and fixed one minor bug.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All previously identified issues were resolved in this session as part of Sprint 10.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Framer Motion.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic, APScheduler for cron jobs.
- **Database**: MongoDB, Alembic-style migrations for data seeding.
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow with automated token refresh using Axios interceptors.
- **3rd Party APIs**: YouTube Data API v3, YouTube Analytics API.
- **LLM**: Gemini 2.0 Flash via .

**key DB schema**
  - No schema changes. The  collection was populated with new documents.

**changes in tech stack**
  - No new dependencies were installed. The agent implemented the token refresh logic using the existing  library.

**All files of reference**
- **Created:**
  - : Seeds the database with new blog articles.
  - : Contains the Axios instance with an interceptor for auto-refreshing the YouTube token.
  - : Component to display competitor video data.
  - : Component to display trending keyword data.
- **Updated:**
  - : Implemented new interactive idea cards.
  - : Added a tabbed interface for Performance and Trend Intelligence.
  - : Reworked the entire page for CPM-based ROI calculation.
  - : Updated to show live channel health stats.
  - : Added graceful error handling for empty data.
  - : Fixed tone pre-population logic.
  - : Fixed thumbnail rendering (by testing agent).
  - : Renamed a navigation link and added a badge component.
  - : Documented the completion of Sprint 10.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- **Media Services**: Future task to refactor media services to make S3 the primary storage mechanism.

**key api endpoints**
- The agent primarily interacted with existing GET endpoints. A key logic change was implementing a frontend-side refresh mechanism that calls the existing  endpoint when a 401 is detected.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Sprint 10 is complete.** All requirements from the user's detailed prompt have been implemented, tested, and verified by the agent.
- The next step is to await user verification of the completed work.
- The next set of tasks are listed under Upcoming Tasks, starting with the integration of TikTok and Instagram Reels.
- The YouTube token auto-refresh is a critical piece of new functionality implemented on the frontend using an Axios interceptor in .
