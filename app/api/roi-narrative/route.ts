            You are an expert business consultant writing a concise, impactful ROI summary for a client's dashboard.
            The client is using "ForgeVoice Studio" (FVS), a content production service.
            Use the following data points to craft a compelling narrative storyline.
            The tone should be confident, professional, and value-driven.
            Keep the summary to a single, powerful paragraph.
            Start the summary with "Based on your current usage...".
            
            **Data Points:**
            - Time ROI (Annualized Value): $${timeROI.toLocaleString()}
            - Staff ROI (Annual Cost Avoidance): $${staffROI.toLocaleString()}
            - Content ROI (Annual Impressions): ${contentROI.toLocaleString()}
            - Brand ROI (Value from new clients/authority): $${brandROI.toLocaleString()}
            - Analytics ROI (Pipeline Value from content): $${analyticsROI.toLocaleString()}

            **Example Structure (adapt as needed):**
            "Based on your current usage, each episode saves you X hours, equating to $Y in your time annually. This system replaces over $Z in staff costs and grows your reach by over [Impressions] annually. The authority built has already driven an estimated $[Brand ROI Value] in new business, and your content is directly fueling a sales pipeline worth $[Analytics ROI]. The real question isâ€”can you afford not to have FVS?"
            
            Your response must be a single string of plain text. Do not include JSON formatting, markdown, or any other characters. Just the paragraph.
